# M2X

Warehousing is increasingly relying on automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). However, the implementation of such automated guided vehicle systems (AGVS) is both time-consuming and cost-intensive and poses a challenge for both large companies and SMEs. Interface definitions such as VDA 5050 standardize the connection between a master controller and AGVs and enable the cost-efficient use of heterogeneous fleets through interoperability. The M2X project, in cooperation with the VDMA and industry partners, aims to reduce integration costs through further standardization in the AGVS context. Further necessary interfaces are identified and described using easily applicable, generally valid models. M2X enables companies to integrate automation quickly and cost-effectively. This gives companies a sustainable competitive advantage and secures their future on the market.

The project and the associated requirements are defined and iteratively adapted in close communication with our partners. The interfaces identified so far for M2X are as follows:
*	Load handling station,
*	Order generation,
*	Peripherals (doors, elevators, (signal) lamps and traffic lights,
*	AGV to AGV or attachment.

In our next steps, we will deal with the load handling and order generation interfaces.
