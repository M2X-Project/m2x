# M2X

Warehousing is increasingly relying on automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). However, the implementation of such an automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) is both time-consuming and cost-intensive and poses a challenge for both large companies and SMEs. Interface definitions such as VDA 5050 standardize the connection between a master controller and AGVs and enable the cost-efficient use of heterogeneous fleets through interoperability. 


The M2X project, in cooperation with the VDMA and industry partners, aims to reduce integration costs through further standardization in the AGV context. Further necessary interfaces are identified and described using easy-to-use, generally applicable models.
